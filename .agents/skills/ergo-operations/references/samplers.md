# Samplers

Samplers are first-class processes spawned by the MCP application that capture data into a ring buffer over time. Two modes: **active** (periodically call any MCP tool) and **passive** (subscribe to logs and/or events). Use them for trend analysis, catching transient states, and reproducing intermittent symptoms.

> Not to be confused with **trace samplers** (`gen.TracingSampler`), a separate framework concept that decides whether a message starts a distributed trace. See the Trace Samplers section at the end of this file for the operator angle, and the canonical `tracing.md` in the framework skill for the full model.

## Lifecycle

1. **Start** - `sample_start` (active) or `sample_listen` (passive) returns a `sampler_id`.
2. **Collect** - the sampler runs until `count` samples reached, `duration_sec` elapses, or `sample_stop` is called.
3. **Read** - `sample_read sampler_id=<id>` any time, including during collection.
4. **Linger** - after completion, the sampler stays alive for `linger_sec` (default 30) so data can still be read. `sample_list` shows `completed, lingering Ns` during this period.
5. **Terminate** - once linger expires or `sample_stop` is called, the sampler process exits.

## Active Samplers (`sample_start`)

Periodically call any MCP tool with fixed arguments. Results land in a ring buffer keyed by sequence number.

```
sample_start tool=runtime_stats interval_ms=5000 duration_sec=300 linger_sec=60
sample_start tool=process_list arguments={"sort_by":"mailbox","limit":5} interval_ms=2000 duration_sec=60
sample_start tool=node_info interval_ms=10000 duration_sec=600
```

Parameters (from `tools.md`):

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `tool` | required | Any MCP tool name |
| `arguments` | `{}` | Tool-specific arguments |
| `interval_ms` | 5000, min 100 | Period between calls |
| `count` | 0 | Stop after N samples (0 = unlimited within duration) |
| `duration_sec` | 60, max 3600 | Wall-clock cap |
| `buffer_size` | 256 | Ring buffer entries (oldest overwritten) |
| `max_errors` | 0 | 0 = retry forever |
| `linger_sec` | 30 | Keep alive after completion |

**`max_errors=0` is the default**. Use it when polling for a rare condition (e.g., catching a process stack when it briefly wakes from sleep) - the sampler keeps retrying until success.

## Passive Samplers (`sample_listen`)

Subscribe to logs and/or one event. Unlike active samplers, no periodic work - entries arrive as they are produced.

```
sample_listen log_levels=["warning","error","panic"] duration_sec=120
sample_listen log_levels=["debug"] log_source="process" duration_sec=60
sample_listen event=price_update event_node=feed@host duration_sec=30
sample_listen log_levels=["error"] event=transactions duration_sec=60
```

Parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `log_levels` | `[info, warning, error, panic]` | Subset of `trace, debug, info, warning, error, panic`. Empty = disable log capture |
| `log_source` | `""` (all) | `process | meta | node | network` |
| `event` | `""` | Event name to subscribe; empty = no event capture |
| `event_node` | local node | Node that owns the event |
| `duration_sec` | 60, max 3600 | |
| `buffer_size` | 256 | |
| `linger_sec` | 30 | |

Both log and event capture can run in the same sampler - combine as needed.

### Passive samplers as test receivers

A passive sampler is an ordinary process. You can `send_message` or `call_process` to its `sampler_id` and the delivery lands in the same ring buffer tagged with `from`, `type`, and `message`. Useful when you need a "message sink" to verify routing:

```
sample_listen duration_sec=60 linger_sec=60
# -> sampler_id: mcp_sampler_AB12CD

send_message to=mcp_sampler_AB12CD type_name=PingRequest message={"Seq":1}
sample_read sampler_id=mcp_sampler_AB12CD
```

The captured entry shows the sender PID, Go type name, and payload.

## Reading Data

```
sample_read sampler_id=<id>              # all buffered entries (since=0)
sample_read sampler_id=<id> since=<seq>  # only entries newer than sequence <seq>
```

Each entry has a `sequence` field. For incremental polling, pass the last sequence you saw back as `since` on the next call.

The response includes the sampler's current status (running / completed / lingering / stopped) - useful for loop termination in automation.

## Managing Samplers

```
sample_list                 # all samplers on this node with config + progress
sample_stop sampler_id=<id> # graceful stop; buffered data remains readable during linger
```

`sample_stop` succeeds on a running sampler and on a stopped-but-still-lingering one. Once linger expires and the sampler process exits, `sample_stop` returns `sampler <id> not found`.

## Proxy Samplers (Cluster-Wide)

When you pass `node=X` to `sample_start` or `sample_listen`, the sampler is **spawned on node X**, not on the MCP entry-point. The tool runs in X's process space. Consequences:

- `sample_read`, `sample_list`, `sample_stop` for this sampler **must** also include `node=X` - the sampler process lives there.
- Cross-node sampling is symmetric: the entry-point has no special status.

Example - watch mailbox pressure on a remote node:

```
sample_start node=backend@host tool=process_list arguments={"sort_by":"mailbox","limit":5} interval_ms=2000 duration_sec=60

# Read later - from ANY MCP session, still addressing node=backend@host
sample_read node=backend@host sampler_id=<id>
```

### Why you almost always want proxy samplers

Each sampler call crosses a network boundary. For high-frequency (100ms-2s interval) or data-heavy (`process_list limit=50`) sampling on a remote node, running the sampler **on** the remote node avoids amplifying that network load.

## Ring Buffer Behaviour

- `buffer_size` (default 256) bounds memory. Once full, the oldest entries are overwritten.
- `sample_read since=0` returns whatever is currently in the buffer - not everything ever produced.
- For long captures on high-rate sources, increase `buffer_size` or periodically `sample_read` with advancing `since` to consume entries before they scroll.

## Common Recipes

### Trend heap over 5 minutes

```
sample_start tool=runtime_stats interval_ms=5000 duration_sec=300 linger_sec=60
# wait, then:
sample_read sampler_id=<id>
```

Plot `heap_alloc` / `heap_objects` over the sequence.

### Catch a goroutine at wake (sleeping process)

```
sample_start tool=pprof_goroutines arguments={"pid":"<PID>"} interval_ms=300 count=1 max_errors=0
```

Tight polling + stop on first success + never give up. `count=1` ends the sampler after one successful capture.

### Top-5 mailbox over a minute

```
sample_start tool=process_list arguments={"sort_by":"mailbox","limit":5} interval_ms=1000 duration_sec=60
```

### Log tail during a repro

```
sample_listen log_levels=["warning","error","panic"] duration_sec=300 linger_sec=60
```

Reproduce the issue in that window, then `sample_read`.

### Watch a specific event's published messages

```
sample_listen event=<name> event_node=<producer-node> duration_sec=120
```

See the actual payloads, not just counters.

## Anti-Patterns

- **No `duration_sec`** -> the sampler runs up to the 3600s cap and leaks attention. Always set a bound.
- **High-frequency remote sampling without `node=X`** -> amplifies network hops per sample.
- **Ignoring `linger_sec`** -> sampler exits before you read; default 30s is usually enough, raise it for long operator sessions.
- **Starting many active samplers with overlapping arguments** -> duplicated load. Use one sampler with a wider `limit` if possible.
- **Using `sample_read` in a tight loop** for real-time display -> wasteful. Use the sequence-based `since` cursor to fetch only new entries.

## Trace Samplers (`gen.TracingSampler`)

Different concept, same word. A **trace sampler** decides, per outgoing `Send`/`Call`, whether that message starts a new distributed trace. It is unrelated to the MCP ring-buffer samplers above. The full model - observation points, attributes, business spans, exporters, cross-node propagation - lives in the framework skill's `tracing.md`. This section is the devops angle: how to turn tracing on to reproduce an intermittent issue on a running node.

The key fact for an operator: **by default no process traces anything.** The default sampler is `gen.TracingSamplerDisable`, so a node can have exporters wired (pulse, observer) and still emit zero spans. Traces are born at the sampler, and the sampler is only consulted when there is no trace already propagating - so enabling it on one entry-point process lights up the entire downstream chain that process kicks off.

### Built-in samplers

| Sampler | Signature | Behavior | `String()` |
|---------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| `gen.TracingSamplerDisable` | var | Never starts a trace. Default for every process and node. | `disable` |
| `gen.TracingSamplerAlways` | var | Starts a trace for every outgoing message. | `always` |
| `gen.TracingSamplerRatio(rate float64)` | constructor | Deterministic every-Nth where `N = floor(1/rate)` (atomic counter, not random). `rate >= 1` returns `Always`; `rate <= 0` returns `Disable`. | `ratio(<rate>)` |
| `gen.TracingSamplerRateLimit(perSecond int)` | constructor | Token bucket capped at `perSecond` new traces per whole Unix second; refills to full at each second boundary (1s granularity, not a sliding window). `perSecond <= 0` returns `Disable`. | `rate_limit(<n>/s)` |

`Ratio` is deterministic - `TracingSamplerRatio(0.01)` traces exactly every 100th message, not "roughly 1%". Very small rates truncate: the effective ratio is `1/floor(1/rate)`. Use `RateLimit` when the goal is to protect the exporter or backend from a trace flood under bursty load.

### Turning it on to reproduce an issue

The operator path is the node-level API on `gen.Node`, which lets you flip a single running process into full tracing without a restart:

| Method | Scope | State |
|--------|-------|-------|
| `Node.SetProcessTracingSampler(pid, sampler) error` | one running process | Running only |
| `Node.SetTracingSampler(sampler) error` | node's own `Send`/`Call` | Running only |
| `Node.TracingSampler() TracingSampler` | current node sampler | all states |
| `Process.SetTracingSampler(sampler) error` | the process itself, from inside `Init`/handlers | Init, Running |
| `Process.TracingSampler() TracingSampler` | current process sampler (`Disable` if unset) | all states |

Typical repro loop for a misbehaving process:

```go
// pin the suspect process to full tracing
node.SetProcessTracingSampler(suspectPID, gen.TracingSamplerAlways)

// ... reproduce the symptom; spans flow to whatever exporters are registered ...

// turn it back off when done
node.SetProcessTracingSampler(suspectPID, gen.TracingSamplerDisable)
```

The Observer web UI exposes the same per-process control, so you can toggle a sampler from the UI instead of code.

### Confirming spans are actually flowing

After setting a sampler, verify traces are being produced before you trust an empty result:

- `node_info` counter `TracingSpans` (a `[5]uint64`, indexed `Send / Request / Response / Spawn / Terminate`) increments as observations are recorded. See `counters.md`.
- On a connection, `network_node_info` counters `TracedSent` / `TracedReceived` count messages carrying trace context across that link - non-zero confirms cross-node propagation is working (which also needs `EnableTracing: true` in `NetworkFlags` on both nodes).

If `TracingSpans` stays flat after you set a non-`Disable` sampler, the suspect process is not the one originating the messages you care about, or no exporter is registered. See `tracing.md` for the full exporter and propagation model.
