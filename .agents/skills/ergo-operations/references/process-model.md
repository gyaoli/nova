# Process Model

The operational reference for interpreting `process_list`, `process_info`, `process_inspect`, and the metrics inside them. Covers states, mailbox queues, metric fields, the liveness formula, and how to read backpressure from telemetry.

## Process States

Returned as strings by `process_state` and inside `ProcessShortInfo.State`.

| State | Constant | Meaning | Allowed ops |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `init` | `ProcessStateInit` | Running `ProcessInit`. Not yet registered, no PID lookup. | Spawn, Send async, setters. No Call, Link, Monitor, RegisterName. |
| `sleep` | `ProcessStateSleep` | Idle, mailbox empty. Goroutine is parked. | All operations. |
| `running` | `ProcessStateRunning` | Dispatching a message. | All operations. |
| `"wait response"` | `ProcessStateWaitResponse` | Blocked in `Call()` awaiting reply. | Limited. Abnormal if > 5s (default Call timeout). |
| `terminated` | `ProcessStateTerminated` | Shutting down. | Send-only. |
| `zombee` | `ProcessStateZombee` | Killed forcibly. Goroutine orphaned. | Nothing. |

Zombies persist in the process table - they are a leak indicator. Investigate with `pprof_goroutines debug=2 filter=<behavior>` to find the stuck goroutine.

## Mailbox Queues (Priority)

Every process has four mailbox queues dispatched in priority order:

| Priority | Constant | Queue | Typical use |
|----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| Max | `MessagePriorityMax` | Urgent | Kill, admin controls |
| High | `MessagePriorityHigh` | System | Framework messages |
| Normal | `MessagePriorityNormal` | Main | Application messages (default) |
| - | - | Log | Log messages (if process is a logger) |

Senders pick a priority via `SendWithPriority` or the process's default `SendPriority`. Every pop checks Urgent -> System -> Main -> Log and returns the first available message.

## MailboxSize

- `MailboxSize = 0` (default): **unlimited**. Mailbox can grow without bound -> source of silent memory growth. Watch `MessagesMailbox` in `process_list sort_by=mailbox`.
- `MailboxSize > 0`: senders receive `gen.ErrProcessMailboxFull` on overflow, unless `ProcessFallback` is configured.

## ProcessShortInfo Fields (visible in process_list)

| Field | Meaning | How to use |
|-------|---------|------------|
| `PID` | Unique identifier | Always cite as `<ABC.0.1005>` |
| `Name` | Registered name | Empty if not registered |
| `Behavior` | Behavior type (e.g. `myapp.Worker`) | Useful in pprof goroutine filters |
| `Kind` | Process kind classifier (`ProcessKind`) | See Process Kind below. Groups rows by role. |
| `Application` | Owning application (empty for root processes) | |
| `State` | See table above | |
| `StateTime` | Time in current state (ns) | Pair with `State`: how long a process has sat in `wait response` or `running`. Rising = stuck. |
| `Parent` | Parent PID | |
| `Leader` | Application leader PID | |
| `Uptime` | Seconds since spawn | |
| `MessagesIn` | Cumulative messages received | |
| `MessagesOut` | Cumulative messages sent | |
| `MessagesMailbox` | **Current** queue depth (all 4 queues combined) | Backpressure indicator |
| `MailboxLatency` | Age of oldest unhandled message (ns) | Requires `-tags=latency`; `-1` if disabled |
| `RunningTime` | Cumulative callback time (ns) | `RunningTime / Uptime` = utilization |
| `InitTime` | `ProcessInit` duration (ns) | Slow init detection |
| `Wakeups` | Sleep->Running transitions | Denominator for Drain |
| `LogLevel` | Current per-process log level | Set at spawn or via `process.Log().SetLevel()` |

`StateTime` complements the Call Timeout section below: a process whose `State` is `wait response` with a `StateTime` above `gen.DefaultRequestTimeout` (5s) has been blocked on a single `Call` longer than the default budget.

## Process Kind

Every process carries a `Kind` (`gen.ProcessKind`, a string). It is resolved once at spawn from the base behavior and emitted in every `process_list` row, so you can group and filter a large node by role at a glance.

The base behaviors report their own kind: `act.Actor` -> `actor`, `act.Supervisor` -> `supervisor`, `act.Pool` -> `pool`, `act.Router` -> `router`, `act.WebWorker` -> `web`. A process built directly on `gen.ProcessBehavior` reports `ProcessKindCustom` (`"custom"`) - the default when a behavior does not report its kind.

`ProcessKind` is a free string. Beyond the topology kinds above, the framework defines a shared classifier vocabulary an actor can adopt to self-describe (via `SetProcessKind` at Init/Running), for example:

| Group | Kinds |
|-------|-------|
| Behavior / flow | `fsm`, `saga`, `worker`, `scheduler`, `queue`, `producer`, `consumer`, `coordinator` |
| Boundary / IO | `web`, `gateway`, `proxy`, `stream`, `broker`, `client` |
| Data / state | `store`, `cache`, `session` |
| Operations | `metrics`, `leader`, `follower`, `health`, `monitor`, `logger` |

Any value not in the vocabulary is still valid and tooling treats it as a custom kind. When triaging an unfamiliar node, `Kind` tells you which rows are supervisors and pools (topology) versus application actors, and which self-declared roles (a `cache`, a `gateway`) are present. See godoc `gen.ProcessKind` for the exhaustive constant list.

## Drain (computed in sort_by)

```
Drain = MessagesIn / Wakeups
```

| Drain | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| `≈ 1` | One message per wake. Idle-reactive; no backpressure. |
| `> 1` | Multiple messages per wake. Queue was building between wake-ups -> overloaded but keeping up. |
| `>> 1` | Severe build-up; likely bottleneck. |

`sort_by=drain` in `process_list` surfaces the hottest actors.

## Utilization

```
Utilization = RunningTime_ns / (Uptime_sec * 1e9)
```

Interpretation:
- Close to 1.0: actor spends nearly all time in callbacks; bottleneck candidate.
- Close to 0: idle or very sparse load.

Utilization is **not** CPU. Two actors each with utilization 1.0 on a multi-core machine do not saturate the CPU - utilization is a per-actor busy ratio.

## MailboxLatency (requires -tags=latency)

`MailboxLatency_ns` is the age of the oldest message still in the queue (from enqueue to the current time). High latency + low utilization = the process is not processing its mailbox (stuck).

A transient non-zero latency (ms range) during active work is normal - it just means we caught the process mid-callback.

## Liveness Score

Detects blocked callbacks (actor holding a mutex, blocked on a channel, doing blocking I/O in a handler). Combines utilization with mailbox latency.

```
Liveness = RunningTime_ns / (Uptime_sec * MailboxLatency_ns)
```

Equivalent to: "how much callback work happens per unit of waiting message age".

### Collection

```
process_list min_mailbox=1 min_uptime=60 min_messages_in=1 sort_by=mailbox_latency limit=10
```

Filters: pending messages (`min_mailbox=1`), alive > 60s (warmup), has received any messages (excludes brand-new processes), sorted by oldest message age. Exclude processes in `zombee` state from results.

### Interpretation

| MailboxLatency | Liveness | Diagnosis | Action |
|----------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| High (seconds) | `> 0.01` | Overloaded but alive - can't drain fast enough | Scale: pool, more workers, or shed load |
| High (seconds) | `< 0.001` | Callback blocked - holding mailbox without processing | Find blocking call: `pprof_goroutines debug=2 filter=<behavior>` |
| 0 | n/a | Healthy, mailbox empty | No action |
| Transient (ms) | any | Caught mid-callback | Normal - re-sample |

**Worked example:** same 18s MailboxLatency, two different processes.
- `RunningTime = 5000s, Uptime = 600s` -> `Liveness = 5000e9 / (600 * 18e9) ≈ 0.46` - heavily busy but alive.
- `RunningTime = 82µs, Uptime = 600s` -> `Liveness = 82e3 / (600 * 18e9) ≈ 7.6e-12` - stuck.

## Call Timeout

`gen.DefaultRequestTimeout` = 5 seconds. A process stuck in `"wait response"` for > 5s is abnormal - either the remote never returned or the response was lost. Check with `pprof_goroutines debug=2 filter=waitResponse`.

## Restart Detection

- `max_uptime=10` returns processes younger than 10s. Many rows here during steady-state = restart loop somewhere.
- Inspect the parent supervisor with `process_inspect pid=<supervisor>` to see `restarts_count`, strategy, intensity, period.
- `gen.ErrExceeded` ("limit exceeded") on a supervisor means its restart-intensity sliding window filled up. The supervisor terminates and escalation propagates to the parent supervisor. See `framework-internals.md`.

## Termination Reasons

At termination the framework tags every process with a reason. Two are graceful, two are abnormal. The distinction drives whether the node logs the exit and whether you should be alarmed - and it is the reason value you see in down and exit messages during a restart cascade.

| Reason | Constant | Graceful | Logging at termination |
|--------|----------|----------|------------------------|
| `normal` | `gen.TerminateReasonNormal` | Yes | None. Process returned this from a handler to stop itself. |
| `shutdown` | `gen.TerminateReasonShutdown` | Yes | None. Node is stopping (`node.Stop()`), children terminate in order. |
| `kill` | `gen.TerminateReasonKill` | No | Error logged. `node.Kill(pid)` or a kill signal - immediate, no graceful shutdown. |
| `panic` | `gen.TerminateReasonPanic` | No | Panic logged with stack trace. A handler panicked; the framework recovered and terminated the process. |

A `kill` delivered while the process is dispatching a message is exactly what leaves a process in `zombee` state (see Process States) - the goroutine is abandoned mid-callback. During a restart-loop investigation, an exit reason of `normal` or `shutdown` is expected traffic; `kill` and `panic` are the ones to trace back to a cause. Correlate with the log capture from the Restart Detection playbook (`sample_listen log_levels=["error","panic"]`).

## Meta Processes

Meta processes are identified by `gen.Alias`, not `gen.PID`. Use `meta_inspect alias=<alias>` (not `process_inspect`). Their info lives in a separate `MetaInfo` structure.

## Metrics to Watch per Symptom

| Symptom | Fields |
|---------|--------|
| Slow messages on one actor | `MessagesMailbox`, `MailboxLatency`, `RunningTime/Uptime`, Drain |
| Memory growth | `MessagesMailbox` across all (default unlimited mailbox), heap via `pprof_heap`, `node_info.MemoryUsed` |
| Stuck callbacks | Liveness score - low value with non-zero latency |
| Process leak | `node_info.ProcessesSpawned` vs `ProcessesTerminated` |
| Restart loop | `process_list max_uptime=10`, `process_inspect` on supervisor |
| Zombie accumulation | `process_list state=zombee` |
| Pool saturation | `process_inspect` on Pool PID - `messages_unhandled` counter |
